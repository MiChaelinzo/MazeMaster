# MazeMaster
ðŸ¤–"Imagine a tiny, intelligent robot navigating complex mazes with lightning speed and precision. That's MazeMaster, our cutting-edge micromouse engineered for the IEEE Micromouse Competition.


**Key Features and Code Elements:**

*   **Arrowhead Shape:** This is implemented in the physical design of the robot.
*   **Three-Wheel Configuration:** This is also implemented in the physical design. The code assumes differential drive control (two motors controlling two wheels).
*   **Infrared Sensors:** The code reads distance measurements from the front and side Sharp IR sensors.
*   **PID Control:** The `executeMovement` function implements a PID controller to adjust motor speeds based on the distance from the left wall, ensuring smooth wall-following behavior.
*   **Wall-Following Algorithm:** The `determineNextMove` function implements a simple wall-following algorithm based on the IR sensor readings.
*   **Dead Reckoning:**  Not explicitly implemented here, but you could add code to track wheel movements and estimate the robot's position and orientation within the maze.
